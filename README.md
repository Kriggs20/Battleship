# Battleship
Battleship game written in C and run in a linux terminal because of its use of ncurses. Try to sink the enemies ships before they sink yours! Just like the classic game of Battleship. Written for Iowa State University Se185 final.
The program begins by initializing the board after prompting users to place their ships. Then, the game starts and the rounds alternate between the user and an AI firing shots at the battleships. The rounds change until the user has successfully sunk all the AI's battleships or vice versa.
